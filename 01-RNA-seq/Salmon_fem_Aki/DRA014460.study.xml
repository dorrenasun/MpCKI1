            <STUDY_ABSTRACT>The phytohormone cytokinins are known to regulate various physiological events in plants. Cytokinin signaling pathway is conserved in the basal land plant Marchantia polymorpha, and has essential roles in organ formation.  To identify genes controlled downstream of the type-B response regulator (MpRRB)-mediated cytokinin signaling, we performed RNA-seq analysis. The data of three biological replicates of wild-type, the MpCKX2-overexpressing line and the Mprrb knockout line were used.</STUDY_ABSTRACT>
